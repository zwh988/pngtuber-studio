# PROJECT_STATE.md

Living document: how the project works right now and where everything lives. **Update it at the end of every task** (see the checklist in `CLAUDE.md`). Keep it factual and short; link to files instead of copying code.

- **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 (M0 risk spike finished)
- **Current milestone:** M0 done, pending merge and tag. Next: M1.
- **Overall status:** design complete, spike scripts exist under `scripts/spike/`, no app code yet. M0 verdict: **GO**, with the caveats listed under "M0 findings".

## How to run / test

The app itself is not runnable yet (no `install.bat` / `run.bat`). The spike scripts are runnable from the repo root in PowerShell.

```powershell
# setup (manual, until install.bat exists)
uv sync                      # Python 3.11, torch 2.6.0+cu126, chatterbox-tts, fastapi, uvicorn, pywebview

# ffmpeg (not committed, bin/ is git-ignored): BtbN 8.1 release branch, NOT master or 9.0 (see M0 findings)

```

First run of `tts_test.py` downloads the Chatterbox weights from Hugging Face (several GB, one-time network step). Later runs are offline.

## M0 findings (2026-10-10, user's machine)

**Machine:** Windows, RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (8 GB), NVIDIA driver 581.42.

**Versions that worked (user confirmed):** Python 3.11.17, torch 2.6.0+cu126, torchaudio 2.6.0+cu126, chatterbox-tts 0.1.7, numpy 1.26.4, transformers 5.2.0, ffmpeg n8.1.3-17-gc389840894 (BtbN GPL build, 8.1 branch). Other package versions are in `uv.lock`.

**Chatterbox (original `ChatterboxTTS`, not Turbo or Multilingual):**
- API: `ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")`, then `generate(text, audio_prompt_path=..., exaggeration=0.5, cfg_weight=0.5, temperature=0.8, ...)`. Sample rate is `model.sr` = 24000.
- `generate` has **no seed argument**. The scripts call `torch.manual_seed(seed)` before each call. Whether that makes output reproducible is **untested**.
- Timings: import 5.3 s, model load 9.0 s (weights cached). First generation 27.4 s (one-time warmup), later lines about 4.6 s for 5 to 6 s of audio (roughly real time). The progress bar shows about 35 to 40 it/s.
- VRAM: 2.99 GiB after load, 3.60 GiB peak during generation, 4.83 of 8.00 GiB in use device-wide (desktop apps included). Peak with a browser or pywebview window open at the same time was **not measured**.
- Voice quality (user confirmed): with the neutral reference (`NanairoMiku_Ref_02_Neutral-enhanced-v2.wav`), voices sound realistic but flat. Neutral 0.50/0.50 usable, slightly slow. Excited 0.75/0.35 sounded flat and sarcastic. Nervous 0.65/0.40 sounded the same as neutral. Exaggeration 1.0 to 1.2 adds some cadence and pitch movement, but the voice gets slightly garbled ("underwater"). Open questions: whether a reference clip with real emotion widens the range, and whether the "enhanced" reference clip contributes to the artifacts.

**Player (user confirmed):** hand-written HTTP Range endpoint in FastAPI plus `<video>` in a pywebview window plays a 4.8 GB, 10 min OBS MKV (H.264, 2560x1440, 60 fps, AAC stereo) with sound. Seeks completed in 17 to 281 ms. The browser issues open-ended `bytes=N-` requests, answered with 206.

**NVENC (user confirmed):** `h264_nvenc` works with ffmpeg n8.1.3. A 10 s 1440p60 to 1080p60 encode ran at 4.4x to 4.9x realtime, about 12 to 13 MB per 10 s at `-cq 23`. Output plays with picture and audio correct. The ffmpeg `master` build (N-127271) and 9.0 builds fail on this driver with "Required: 13.1 Found: 13.0 / minimum driver 610". Working command is in "How to run / test".

**Footage facts (user's OBS recordings):** MKV, H.264 High yuv420p bt709, 2560x1440, 60 fps, single stereo AAC track (48 kHz), about 62 Mbps. Recording frame rate is 60.

**Go / no-go: GO.** All three risks cleared. Caveat: emotional range from the voice clone is limited with a neutral reference clip, so emotion presets alone may not be enough. Treat in M3 (tune by ear, try an expressive reference clip).

## Decisions log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-10 | Windows + NVIDIA 6GB+; Python backend + pywebview shell, fully offline after first run |
| 2026-10-10 | Footage editing = cut, splice, speed via an edit decision list (clip list + effects registry), built to scale |
| 2026-10-10 | Footage is placed manually in the project `footage/` folder; app never copies it |
| 2026-10-10 | Lines live in a per-project bank, are placed later; every generation is a kept take |
| 2026-10-10 | Overflow: warning + one-click fixes (tighten, nudge, regenerate); per-line allow-overlap |
| 2026-10-10 | Cloned voice via Chatterbox; voice profile abstraction so the reference can change |
| 2026-10-10 | Emotion = presets + per-line sliders (exaggeration, cfg_weight) |
| 2026-10-10 | Avatar drawn live; Python solver is single source of truth; expression, parameter lanes, and reactions are keyframed |
| 2026-10-10 | Mouth from loudness envelope (Rhubarb deferred) |
| 2026-10-10 | Game audio fixed level; voice bus = 3-band EQ, optional compressor, effects, LUFS normalize |
| 2026-10-10 | Export: 1080p MP4 + asset bundle (raw/processed voice, edited video, hard-linked raw video, optional overlay) |
| 2026-10-10 | Channel template auto-applies intro/outro, voice, FX, avatar, export defaults; bookends are ordinary clips |
| 2026-10-10 | Correction: Chatterbox `cfg_weight` is pacing guidance (lower = slower, more deliberate), not literal speed |
| 2026-10-10 | Work method: plain chat with no agent tooling; user pastes files in, applies output and runs everything by hand on Windows PowerShell |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: use original `ChatterboxTTS` 0.1.7. It requires `torch==2.6.0`, so the project pins torch 2.6.0+cu126 from the cu126 index and `requires-python = "==3.11.*"` |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: pin `setuptools<81`. `resemble-perth` imports `pkg_resources`; without it `PerthImplicitWatermarker` is `None` and model load fails with a `TypeError`. Include in `install.bat`/lockfile |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: Chatterbox `generate` has no seed parameter; the seed in the take cache key is applied via `torch.manual_seed` before each call (reproducibility to be verified in M3) |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: bundle a pinned ffmpeg **release-branch** build (BtbN GPL 8.1.x), never `master` or 9.0. Newer builds need NVENC API 13.1 (driver 610+); driver 581.42 provides 13.0. Record the ffmpeg version in the install script and show a clear error if NVENC fails to open |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: video playback = custom Range endpoint (`scripts/spike/player_spike.py`: `parse_range`, `iter_file`) served to a `<video>` tag; OBS MKV/H.264 plays and seeks without remuxing |
| 2026-10-10 | M0: recordings are 2560x1440@60; export scales to 1080p (verified with NVENC, `scale=-2:1080`) |

## Known issues / open questions

- Voice source not final: own voice or acted character (swappable via voice profile).
- Emotion range: neutral reference gives flat output; exaggeration >= 1.0 adds some expression but garbles slightly. Test an expressive reference clip and a non-"enhanced" clip in M3. Emotion preset numbers are still starting guesses.
- Seed reproducibility via `torch.manual_seed` is untested (matters for cache keys, rule 3).
- VRAM peak with the pywebview window open during generation is unmeasured.
- First generation after model load took 27 s (warmup); the UI should show progress and the worker should warm up on start.
- Effects slot contents not chosen (reverb, pitch shift, chorus, others).
- Avatar art naming convention `expression_eyes_mouth.png` to be confirmed against real files.
- OBS recordings have one mixed audio track (game and mic together); confirm this is the expected workflow.
- Harmless warnings seen: `pkg_resources` deprecation (from perth), diffusers `LoRACompatibleLinear` deprecation, `sdpa` attention note, unauthenticated Hugging Face Hub notice.
- Seek latency was measured on a 4.8 GB file by eye from the page log; no systematic benchmark.

## Next up

1. Merge `m0-spike` into `main` and tag `m0-done`.
2. M1: see `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
